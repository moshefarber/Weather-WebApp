    		<p> Weather.ly aims to become your companion weather web application. Enter your location, and using the Weather UnderGround API, it will pull in the current forecast, as well as the 7 day outlook. Background images depicting the current condtions accompany your report. 
    		</p>
    		<p>Some feature additions that we hope to add in the future are a suggested clothing list based on the hourly weather report for that day, and to implement another API that will display images relevant to the users location.
